# `fed3`

`fed3` will be a Python package for analzing and plotting [FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3) data.  The functionality of `fed3` will largely be the same as the GUI, [FED3 Viz](https://github.com/earnestt1234/FED3_Viz).  The eventual goal is to have one single code base which can be used by the GUI as well as in a Python interpreter.
