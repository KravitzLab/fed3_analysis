# `fed3`

`fed3` will be a Python package for analzing and plotting [FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3) data.  The functionality of `fed3` will largely be the same as the GUI, [FED3 Viz](https://github.com/earnestt1234/FED3_Viz).  The eventual goal is to have one single code base which can be used by the GUI as well as in a Python interpreter.

`fed3` does not have a working full release yet.  If you would like to test `fed3` in its current state, you can install it from the command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/earnestt1234/fed3
cd fed3
pip install .
```
You can also see the `packagetesting.py` file to see the small examples I am working on.  Funcionality is currently limited and without documentation!
