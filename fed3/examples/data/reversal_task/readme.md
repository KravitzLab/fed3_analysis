These are example FED3 data files collected from mice performing a reversal learning task.  The rewarded nosepoke switches each time the mice earn 40 pellets.  For instance, the program starts with the Left poke delivering a pellet, but after the mouse earns 40 pellets it switches to the Right poke, after 80 pellets back to the Left poke, etc.

Task was run for 4-5 days, resulting in several hundred earned pellets
