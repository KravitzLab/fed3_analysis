These are example FED3 data files collected from mice performing an PR1 task in which the number of required pokes increments each time they earn a pellet. For instance, the first pellet requires 1 poke, the second 2 pokes, etc.  The trick is that if a mouse does not earn a pellet for 30 minutes the requirement resets.  This allows mice to run on this task for days, without the requirement becoming too challenging for them to obtain their daily food requirements.
